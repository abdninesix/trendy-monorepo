# MonoRepo with TurboRepo

## Introduction

Today, we are exploring a new tech approach called **MonoRepo**. In this architecture, multiple applications are managed within a single repository. The goal of this setup is to streamline our project, improve deployment efficiency, and simplify the management of various services.

For this purpose, we are using **TurboRepo**, which optimizes the deployment of multiple applications in a MonoRepo by rebuilding only the applications that have changes instead of rebuilding the entire repository each time.

In this project, we will be focusing on two main applications:

* **Trendy Store** (Frontend Application)
* **Trendy Dashboard** (Admin Dashboard Application)

Both of these applications will be designed to use **Microservices**, with each service working independently, making the system modular and scalable.

## Goals

* Implement a MonoRepo setup using TurboRepo.
* Optimize deployment workflows by ensuring that only changed applications are rebuilt.
* Maintain modularity through microservices for both the frontend and backend applications.
* Improve project structure and collaboration between teams.

## Benefits

* **Faster Deployments**: With TurboRepo, we only rebuild the application or service that has changed, making deployments faster and more efficient.
* **Simplified Project Management**: Having all applications in a single repository reduces the complexity of managing multiple repositories.
* **Independent Microservices**: Each service operates independently, allowing for better scalability, maintenance, and testing.
* **Better Collaboration**: Teams can work on different parts of the system without interfering with each other’s work.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   TurboRepo manages the entire monorepo, so ensure you have all dependencies installed.

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run Applications**

   * Start both **Trendy Store** and **Trendy Dashboard**:

     ```bash
     turbo dev
     ```

4. **Microservices Configuration**
   Each application will interact with its respective microservices. Ensure each service is independently deployable and testable.

## Folder Structure

```bash
├── apps/
│   ├── trendy-store/          # Frontend application
│   └── trendy-dashboard/      # Admin dashboard application
├── packages/
│   ├── service-a/             # Microservice A (e.g., Auth)
│   └── service-b/             # Microservice B (e.g., Product Management)
└── turbo.json                 # TurboRepo configuration file
```

## Key Concepts

### TurboRepo

TurboRepo is a high-performance build system for JavaScript and TypeScript monorepos. It helps optimize workflows by intelligently determining which parts of the repository need rebuilding or redeploying based on changes made.

### Microservices Architecture

In this project, each application and its associated backend services are independent. This allows teams to work on services without worrying about the overall application. Services can be scaled independently based on demand.

## Deployment

With the use of TurboRepo, only the changed parts of the repository will be rebuilt and deployed. This makes the deployment process significantly more efficient, especially as the project grows and more services are added.

### Deployment Steps:

1. Push your changes to the main branch.
2. TurboRepo will detect the changes and only rebuild the affected applications.
3. The deployment process is optimized to rebuild only the necessary components, minimizing downtime and improving efficiency.

## Technologies Used

* **MonoRepo** architecture
* **TurboRepo** for optimized build and deployment
* **Microservices** for independent application services
* **Node.js** and **React** for the frontend applications
* **Express.js** for the backend microservices (if applicable)

## Future Considerations

* Add additional microservices as the application grows.
* Explore caching strategies to further optimize rebuild times.
* Implement continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD) pipelines to automate the deployment process.
