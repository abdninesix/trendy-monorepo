Today I will be trying a new tech. MonoRepo.
In this tech we contain multiple applications in a single repo.
For this purpose we will be using TurboRepo.
Using this we can optimize the deployment of our multiple applications.
Each time there's a new change in our project, the deployment will only rebuild the change instead of all the applications in the MonoRepo.
We are building our previous frontend and applications (Trendy Store and Trendy Dashboard).
